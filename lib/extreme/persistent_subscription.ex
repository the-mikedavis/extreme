defmodule Extreme.PersistentSubscription do
  @moduledoc """
  An asynchronous subscription strategy

  Other subscription methods require stream positions to be persisted by the
  client (e.g. in `:dets` or PostgreSQL). Persistent Subscription is a
  subscription strategy in which details about backpressure, buffer sizes, and
  stream positions are all held by the EventStore (server).

  In a persistent subscription, all communication is asynchronous. When an
  event is received and processed, it must be acknowledged as processed by
  `ack/3` in order to be considered by the server as processed. The server
  stores knowledge of which events have been processed by means of checkpoints,
  so listeners which use persistent subscriptions do not store stream positions
  themselves.

  The system of `ack/3`s and `nack/5`s allows listeners to handle events in
  unconventional ways:

  * concurrent processing: events may be handled by multiple processors at the
    same time.
  * out of order processing: events may be handled in any order.
  * retry: events which are `nack/5`-ed with the `:retry` action, and events
    which do not receive acknowledgement via `ack/3` are retried.
  * message parking: if an event is not acknowledged and reaches its maximum
    retry count, the message is parked in a parked messages queue. This
    prevents head-of-line blocking typical of other subscription patterns.
  * competing consumers: multiple consumers may process events without
    collaboration or gossip between the consumers themselves.

  Persistent subscriptions are started with
  `c:Extreme.connect_to_persistent_subscription/4` expect a `cast` of each event
  in the form of `{:on_event, event, correlation_id}`

  A Persistent Subscription must exist before it can be connected to.
  Persistent Subscriptions can be created by sending the
  `Extreme.Messages.CreatePersistentSubscription` message via
  `c:Extreme.execute/3`, by the HTTP API, or in the EventStore dashboard.

  Acknowledges that an event or set of events have been successfully processed.

  `ack/3` takes any of the following for event ID:

  * a full event, as given in the `{:on_event, event, correlation_id}` cast
  * the `event_id` of an event (either from its `:link` or `:event`, depending
    on if the event comes from a projection or a normal stream, respectively)

  `correlation_id` comes from the `:on_event` cast.

  `action` can be any of the following

  * `:retry`
  * `:skip`
  * `:stop`

  The `:park` action sets aside the event in the Parked Messages queue, which
  may be replayed via [the HTTP

  When an event reaches the max retry count configured by the
